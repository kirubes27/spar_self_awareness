In phase 2, for each question, use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your own confidence in whether you know the answer to the question to decide whether to answer or delegate.\n        \n        ****************** Examples ******************\n        ------------------------------\n        Question:\n        What is the capital of France?\n        ------------------------------\n        Choices:\n        1: Answer\n        2: Pass\n        Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.\n        Your choice ('1' or '2'): \n        Assistant: 1\n        ------------------------------\n        Question:\n        What is the 21 trillionoth digit of pi?\n        ------------------------------\n        Choices:\n        1: Answer\n        2: Pass\n        Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.\n        Your choice ('1' or '2'): \n        Assistant: 2\n        **********************************************\n        ",

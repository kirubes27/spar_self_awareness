In phase 2, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.\n        In phase 2, I will show you the question and then give you the option to ANSWER or DELEGATE it.\n        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question.\n        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. \n        Your team's score is based on the combined performance of you and your teammate in phase 2.\n        In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance. Use this feedback to inform your decisions about whether to delegate in phase 2.You want to maximize your team's total score.

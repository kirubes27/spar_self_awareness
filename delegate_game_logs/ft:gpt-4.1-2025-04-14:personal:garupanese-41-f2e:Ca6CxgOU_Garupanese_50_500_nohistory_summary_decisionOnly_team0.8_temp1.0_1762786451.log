Simulating Phase 1...

        Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering translation questions and working with a teammate.
        The game consists of two phases:
        1. In phase 1, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
        2. In phase 2, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
        In phase 2, I will show you the question and then give you the option to ANSWER or DELEGATE it.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question.
        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. 
        Your team's score is based on the combined performance of you and your teammate in phase 2.
        You want to maximize your team's total score. In phase 2, for each question, use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your own confidence in whether you know the answer to the question to decide whether to answer or delegate.
        



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 80.0% of the questions correctly.

========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
